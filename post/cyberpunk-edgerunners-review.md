# Cyberpunk: Edgerunners - A Neon Heartbreak

Studio Trigger's adaptation of the Cyberpunk 2077 universe isn't just a tie-in; it's a genre-defining masterpiece that explores the cost of dreams in Night City.

## Narrative Excellence
The story of David Martinez is a tragic trajectory we've seen a thousand times, yet it feels visceral. It’s not about the destination (which the genre demands is usually death), but the *velocity*.

### Why it Hits Different:
- **Visual Overload**: The classic Trigger "fluidity" meets gritty urban decay.
- **Auditory Memory**: *I Really Want to Stay at Your House* is now synonymous with sadness.
- **Chrome and Soul**: The exploration of cyberpsychosis as a metaphor for societal pressure.

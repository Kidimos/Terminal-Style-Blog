# The Shattering of the Elden Ring

The Lands Between are steeped in myth, blood, and the fragments of a god. Understanding Queen Marika's betrayal is the key to understanding the game's cycle.

## The Greater Will
The Elden Ring is more than just a tool; it is the manifestation of cosmic order. When Marika shattered it, she didn't just break a physical object—she broke the laws of existence (like Death).

### Key Players:
1. **Marika/Radagon**: The duality of the god-ruler.
2. **Ranni the Witch**: The one who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives to escape her destiny.
3. **Miquella**: Seeking a world free from the influence of Outer Gods.

The Tarnished return to a world that has forgotten grace, seeking to mend what was broken or perhaps to replace it with a new age entirely.
